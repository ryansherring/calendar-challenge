# calendar-challenge
This was my first calendar so I enjoyed solving this one. If I were to try again, I might try and hit that 50 line of code mark with the grid layout instead of the inbetween-spacing option. I originally had an issue with the dates loading correctly but, on coming home on sunday, I realized I was missing a setDate() at the beginning of my calendar render handler and that fixxed the issue.
